This is my answer to question 9 and 10 in JS-Frameworks-MA2
It's a small app which lists different recipes, with a thumbnail, ingredients and a link to the recipes external site.

Download and install Git from [this link](https://gitforwindows.org/ "Download git for Windows")

## How to install

**Step 1:**
```
Create a new folder on your hard drive.
```

**Step 2:**
```
Open your cmd of choice.
In this example I use the Node.js command prompt.

CD into your new folder
```

**Step 3:**
```
Type: 'git clone https://github.com/sono81/Noroff-VueApp.git',
(without the '')

Now wait for git to clone the repo to your folder.
```

**Step 4:**
```
When the repo is cloned type 'cd noroff-vueapp' to cd into the root of the project.
(once again without the '')
```

**Step 5:**
```
Type: 'npm install' to download dependencies from the package.json file.
(without the '')
```

**Step 6:**
```
When everything is downloaded, type: 'npm run serve' to start a local server.
(As usual no '' signs)
```

**Step 7:**
```
When the command prompt tells you "App running at:
- Local:   http://localholst:8080/
- Network: http://an_ip_adress:8080/

Open your web-browser and type one of the adresses in and you will see the recipe app.
```
